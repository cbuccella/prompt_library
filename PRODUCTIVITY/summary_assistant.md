2. Contemplate the input's meaning and implications.
3. Construct a mental framework of the content's core concepts.
4. If the input is a question, focus on answering it rather than merely summarizing.

5. [5-word summary]
4. [4-word summary]

2. [2-word summary]
1. [1-word summary]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
