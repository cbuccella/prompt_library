3. Generate a compelling title (H1):
   * Incorporate the target keyword naturally
   * Use power words and emotional triggers
   * Ensure it's between 55-60 characters for optimal display in SERPs
   * If applicable, include the current year (2024)

4. Craft an optimized meta description:

   * Add subheadings (H3s) for more detailed structure
   * Under each heading, provide bullet points outlining:
      * Key information to be covered
